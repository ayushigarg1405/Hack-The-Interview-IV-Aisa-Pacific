Question:

A classroom has several students, half of whom are boys and half of whom are girls. You need to arrange all of them in a line for the morning assembly such that the following 
conditions are satisfied:

The students must be in order of non-decreasing height.
Two boys or two girls must not be adjacent to each other.
You have been given the heights of the boys in the array  and the heights of the girls in the array . 
Find out whether you can arrange them in an order which satisfies the given conditions. Print "YES" if it is possible, or "NO" if it is not.

For example, let's say there are  boys and  girls, where the boys' heights are  and the girls' heights are . 
These students can be arranged in the order , which is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]. 
Because this is in order of non-decreasing height, and no two boys or two girls are adjacent to each other, this satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the answer is "YES".

Solution Approach:

Making use of prioriy queue for store elemnets of both the array in non decreasing order.
Until queue is not empty, pop out first two elements and check whether they are in different array. 
If yes, continue else return "NO".

Solution:

string arrangeStudents(vector<int> a, vector<int> b) {
    sort(a.begin(),a.end());
    sort(b.begin(),b.end());
    
    int n = a.size();
    if(n==1)
        return "YES";
    if(n==0)
        return "NO";
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        pq.push(a[i]);
        pq.push(b[i]);
    }
    
    int i=0;
    while(!pq.empty()){
        int num1 = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        int num2 = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        
        if(num1==a[i] and num2==b[i]){
            i++;
            continue;
        }    
        else if(num1==b[i] and num2==a[i]){
            i++;
            continue;
        }   
        else
            return "NO";
        
    }
    return "YES";
}
